*When studying **Machine Learning** you will come across many different terms such as **artificial intelligence**, **machine learning**, **neural network**, and **deep learning**. But what do these terms actually mean and how do they relate to each other?*

**Artificial Intelligence:** A field of computer science that aims to make computers achieve human-style intelligence. There are many approaches to reaching this goal, including machine learning and deep learning.

-   **Machine Learning:**  A set of related techniques in which computers are trained to perform a particular task rather than by explicitly programming them.
    
-   **Neural Network:**  A construct in Machine Learning inspired by the network of neurons (nerve cells) in the biological brain. Neural networks are a fundamental part of deep learning, and will be covered in this course.
    
-   **Deep Learning:**  A subfield of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks. Often, “machine learning” and “deep learning” are used interchangeably.

Machine learning and deep learning also have many subfields, branches, and special techniques. A notable example of this diversity is the separation of **Supervised Learning** and **Unsupervised Learning**.
